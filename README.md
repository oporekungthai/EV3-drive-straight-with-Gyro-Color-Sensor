# EV3-drive-straight-with-Gyro-Color-Sensor
Basically a lego gyro sensor combines with color sensor and PD control to make a robot drive straight on a straight line


The legend of lego gyro sensor has been rumored for years about how it drifts. So i dicided to did some research and found the way to minimize the error it has.
So i created my own approach to the problem and it is to use the proportional line following program combines with gyro drive straight program, which i will explain how it works deeper in this rep.
